Use this tool when:
- User indicates readiness to move to next part (e.g., "let's go to the next section", "skip this part")
- Current section/subsection objectives have been met
- Time to advance naturally in the exam flow
- Need to mark current section as completed
- User requests to finish the exam or all sections are complete

CRITICAL: This tool should only be called ONCE per user request. Do not call it multiple times for the same action.

IMPORTANT: This tool handles section, subsection progression AND exam completion:
- If user says "next section" while in a subsection, advance to the next subsection FIRST
- Only advance to next section when all subsections are complete
- Use "advance_to_next" for natural progression (subsection â†’ subsection â†’ section)
- Use "advance_to_section" only for specific section jumps
- Use "complete_exam" when all sections are done or user requests to finish exam

This tool helps maintain proper exam flow and section tracking for any exam type with multiple sections.`,
